School System App

`Students` and `Professors` info will be tracked such as *name, age, birthdate 
and phone number* will be tracked. It is for their identification incase we need it.

Each `Student` can enroll in only one `Course` at a time. `Students` enrolling 
for the course should show their *proof of payment* to be confirmed enrolled on 
the course. Every `Course` has uncustomizable line-up of `Subjects` and also has
 1 `Professor` for each.

Every `Student` will take every `Subject` *related* on their `Course`. If a 
`Student` is *under probation* in a subject, he/she will retake that `Subject` 
which is added on the line-up of his/her `Subjects`.




Student will be finally given access to official site of 
his/her Course class where requirements in each subject will be posted. 
`Students' can also attach files of their works in each task per subject.
